Controller to virtual controller mapping.

For now;
wii remote -> virtual xbox controller

# pi0 - wii remote

For setup, take a look at [this gist.](https://gist.github.com/Berghopper/e4a814bbefb9e77d2a628324d8966c99)
(Don't run the commands, just simply follow along.)

An Xbox controller is really well supported on many devices, usually drivers pre-exist for it.
Connecting a Wii remote to a device is a bit more tricky, to say the least.

## I still don't get why

I don't either, but I'm doing it anyway.
