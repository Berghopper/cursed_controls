Controller to virtual controller mapping.

For now;
wii remote -> virtual xbox controller

# pi0 - wii remote

For setup, take a look at the `init-raspbian.sh`, `setup-raspbian.sh` and `run-raspbian.sh` scripts.
These should work out of the box for the pi0.

## But why?

An Xbox controller is really well supported on many devices, usually drivers pre-exist for it.
Connecting a Wii remote to a device is a bit more tricky, to say the least.

## I still don't get why

I don't either, but I'm doing it anyway.
