# cursed_controls
Controller to virtual controller mapping.

For now;
wii remote -> virtual xbox controller

# pi0 - wii remote
## Dependencies
- using xwiimote; [https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/XWiimote](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/XWiimote)

## Other deps
- `sudo apt-get install libvdev-dev`

## But why?

An Xbox controller is really well supported on many devices, usually drivers pre-exist for it.
Connecting a Wii remote to a device is a bit more tricky, to say the least.

## I still don't get why

I don't either, but I'm doing it anyway.
